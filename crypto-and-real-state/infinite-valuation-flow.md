# üíπ INFINITE VALUATION FLOW

The decentralized market relationship with the token follows the flow where the $IMOV token will collect resources, pass it on to the physical company that will hire the services and acquire the properties, carry out the "trading", and the result of this the net profit of the operation will be reverted to the chart in the form of purchase and burning directly in Pancake.\
