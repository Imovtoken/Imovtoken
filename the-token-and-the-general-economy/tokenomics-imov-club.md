#### 💎 PROFITABILITY PROJECTIONS&#x20;

Let's take as an example an application of a bankroll of $1,000,000.00.&#x20;

The average of the market on the coast of Santa Catarina is 100% profitable, which may vary downwards or upwards. Let's consider the application with 100%, that is, $1,000,000.00 of net income.&#x20;

🙋🏽‍♂️ In this simulation, $400,000.00 (40%) would be distributed among the shareholders, yielding $40.00 for each one, considering a total of 10,000 shares sold. This represents a rate of return of 0.004% on all net income, making it one of the highest paying projects.&#x20;

💁🏽‍♂️ In the next round, with the addition of 30% of the net profit to the bankroll, $1,300,000.00 would be invested, yielding $52.00. The next rounds, following this model, would yield $67.00, $87.00, $114.24, and so on.&#x20;

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 In practice this means that only with a contribution through the decentralized market you will have a highly specialized team working to generate contributions for you FOR LIFE.
